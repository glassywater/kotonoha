"""Thin ctypes wrapper around libkoto-layer.so (the Wayland layer-shell bridge).

All methods are safe no-ops when the bridge is unavailable — not built, a
non-Wayland (X11) session, or a Wayland compositor that does not implement
wlr-layer-shell (GNOME/Mutter, Weston, Cinnamon). In those cases the overlay
degrades: on X11 it is a normal top-most window (``_NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE``) that
the WM positions; on a layer-shell-less Wayland session it is an ordinary window
the compositor places and stacks — it cannot stay above other apps and cannot be
positioned precisely (``self.move()`` is a no-op on Wayland).

Backdrop blur is tracked separately from layer-shell (``blur_available`` vs
``available``): it rides on the same library but on its own protocols, so a
Wayland compositor without layer-shell can still frost the panel.
